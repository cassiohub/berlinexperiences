  "about": "Berlin is considered the New York City of Germany, everything that exists is here - fantastic food, the arts, history, education, politics, and capitalism.\n\nItâ€™s easy to get lost in the many neighborhoods, but thanks to the easy to use and access U-Bahn and S-Bahn, one can quickly navigate from one Museum to another or find the best spots for an awe-inspiring meal.\n\nNo matter what, there is a place for everyone here, just make sure you leave enough time to find your spot!"
